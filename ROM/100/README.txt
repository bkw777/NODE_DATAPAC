Oct 2025 - Thanks to Michael Brigham for dumping this rom which was otherwise lost.
The text file manual was also lost until the rom was available to regenerate it.

This ROM is not needed to use the hardware. RAM100.CO/RAM200.CO can be used in place of the ROM.

NODE-DATAPAC-100-1.04.ROM is the NODE option rom v1.04 for 100/102

RAMDSK.DO is a copy of the text file manual created by the rom when it formats a ramdisk

N1DEMO.DO is the ascii basic demo program excerpted out of RAMDSK.DO

N1DEMO.BA is the tokenized basic demo program
