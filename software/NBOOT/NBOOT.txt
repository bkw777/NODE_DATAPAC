NBOOT - generic NODE bootstrap for reference

NBOOT is a larger more generic version of RBOOT
which is not hard-coded to RAM100.CO or RAM200.CO,
nor to Model 100 or 200.

It will load any .CO file saved in the first directory slot on the RAMPAC,
and will read its filename and top/end/exe addresses from the CO header.

The file must be a .CO file, and must be between 1025 and 2038 bytes long,
and must be saved into the first directory entry on the RAMPAC.

Runs the same on Models 100, 102, and 200.

You can customize it to load from bank1 instead of bank0 by changing
K=129 to K=133 on line 1. In this way you could have both 100 and 200
versions of the .CO on the same RAMPAC, and bootstrap either one.
Just like for bank0, the 2nd .CO must be the first file saved on bank1.

There are two slightly different versions.
The difference is what it does with the file after loading.

NBOOTS saves the file.
Uses SAVEM to create FNAME.CO in the ram filesystem (main menu).
You usually want this one.

NBOOTR runs the file.
Uses CALL to immediately jump to execute the loaded bytes.
You usually don't want this one. It's just for reference.

And actually you usually don't want either of these, because you usually
just want to bootstrap RAMDSK, and there is a much smaller bootstrapper
just for RAMDSK which is RBOOT, found in the RAMDSK directory.
