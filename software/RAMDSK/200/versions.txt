There are 2 versions of RAM200.CO

R200v1.CO is renamed from https://ftp.whtech.com/club100/pg/pgnode/node2/ramdsk.co
from http://www.club100.org/library/libpg.html
It appears to be an early version of RAM200.CO
It is smaller than the other version, and does not have support for banks, (later RAMPACs that could have capacities greater than 256k).

RAM200.CO came from https://ftp.whtech.com/club100/eme/r200ld.200
and appears to be a later version. It is larger and has support for banks.

RAM200.DO here is a new one generated by co2ba.sh, but creates the same binary as RAM200.DO from Steve Adolph's directory on club100.org or R200LD.200 from the EME page on club100.org

Neither version has an actual version number that I have been able to find, so I just call them v1 and v2 until I find out better.
