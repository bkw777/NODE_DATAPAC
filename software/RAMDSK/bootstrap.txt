Several archived documents mention a short bootstrap program called BOOT that coule be typed in manually to load RAMDSK.CO from the RAMPAC after a cold reset.

That file is lost to time.

In it's place I have written RBOOT.DO which is very crude but works.

A copy of RAMDSK.CO (or RAM100.CO etc, the name doesn't matter) must previously be saved to RAMPAC,
and it must be the first file saved to the RAMPAC after a fresh format.

This provides a way to recover after a cold reset without any other computer or cassette or anything but the RAMPAC itself, if you have a printed copy of RBOOT.DO to type it in.

To load from bank1 instead of bank0, Change OUT129,2 and OUT129,1 to OUT133,2 and OUT133,1

The routine is very crude and does not actually read or parse the directory block to find the block numbers and block linking order.

It's hard-coded to:
- start reading from block 2
- skip over the first 10 bytes
- read and parse the 6-byte CO header to get the start/length/exec values
- read the rest of the block to get the first 1008 bytes of the file
- switch to block 1
- read bytes right from byte 0 until it reaches the file size to get the rest of the file.

The file size can vary (you can modify RAMDSK.CO, there is an older version that is shorter for instance) as long as it fits within 2 blocks.

Don't ask me why the file is stored starting in block 2 and then finishing in block 1 ! I have NFC.
