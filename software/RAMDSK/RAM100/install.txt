Installation options

--- Initial Install ---

If you have a TPDD client like TS-DOS and a TPDD emulator like LaddieAlpha or dl2:
just copy RAM100.CO to the 100 and run it.
(http://bitchin100.com/wiki/index.php?title=Loading_a_typical_CO_file)

Otherwise you can bootstrap using the BASIC loader over serial from a PC.

For Windows, using https://github.com/bkw777/tsend

  C:> tsend.ps1 -file RAM100.DO

For Mac/Linux, using https://github.com/bkw777/dl2

  $ dl -v -b RAM100.DO


If you want to be able to re-install from the RAMPAC itself in the future,
then once installed, copy RAM100.CO to the RAMPAC as the first file.


--- Re-install from the RAMPAC itself after a cold reset ---

If you have a RAMPAC with a copy of RAM100.CO already on it,
and a Model 100 or 102 that is wiped from a cold reset,
you can type-in RBOOT.100 to reinstall RAMDSK from the RAMPAC.

RAM100.CO must be the first file saved on the RAMPAC.

RBOOT.100 may be customized to load from bank1 instead of bank0
by changing the two occurances of OUT129 to OUT133.
In this case RAM100.CO must be the first file saved in bank1.
