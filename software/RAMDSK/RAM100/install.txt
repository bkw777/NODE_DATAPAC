If you have a TPDD client like TS-DOS, just copy RAM100.CO

To bootstrap from a PC:

Windows, using https://github.com/bkw777/tsend

  C:> tsend.ps1 -file RAM100.DO

Mac/Linux, using https://github.com/bkw777/dl2

  $ dl -v -b RAM100.DO


--- Re-install from the RAMPAC itself after a cold reset ---

If you have a RAMPAC with a copy of RAM100.CO already on it,
and a Model 100/102 that is wiped from a cold reset,
you can manually type-in RBOOT.DO to reinstall RAMDSK from the RAMPAC.

RAM100.CO must be the first file saved to the RAMPAC after a format.
