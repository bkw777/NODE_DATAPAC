If you have a TPDD client like TS-DOS, just copy RAM200.CO

To bootstrap from a PC:

Windows, using https://github.com/bkw777/tsend

  C:> tsend.ps1 -file RAM200.DO

Mac/Linux, using https://github.com/bkw777/dlplus

  $ dl -v -b RAM200.DO


--- Re-install from the RAMPAC itself after a cold reset ---

If you have a RAMPAC with a copy of RAM200.CO on it,
and a Model 200 that is wiped from a cold reset,
you can manually type-in RBOOT.DO to reinstall RAMDSK from the RAMPAC.

RAM200.CO (or RAMDSK.CO, the name doesn't matter) must be the first file
saved to the RAMPAC after a format.
